The logo symbolizes a winner\'s podium to show the institution\'s connection to sport and incorporates the colors of the state of Bremen. Apart from the logo, I also created mockups for business cards and other print media as well as a concept for a <a href="/detail?project=lsb-homepage">redesigned website</a>.'
