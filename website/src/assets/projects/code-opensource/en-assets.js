Because even though visual aspects of my work can easily be presented on this portfolio site, the development aspects are hard or sometimes impossible to showcase in a graphical way.<br /><br />Thanks to participation in Open Source development I am comfortable with writing meaningful issues and code documentation, following different commit conventions, configuring CI and CD pipelines and similar skills. I have also published my own packages such as <a href="https://github.com/jonaskuske/smoothscroll-anchor-polyfill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smoothscroll-anchor-polyfill</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jonaskuske/miniswipe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">miniswipe</a> and contributed to various projects, for example Vue CLI.',
