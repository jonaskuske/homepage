An example would be my JavaScript library »miniswipe« which allows users to easily bind functions to swipe gestures. It is used on this very website so you can open and close the menu on mobile devices by swiping left and right. »miniswipe« and other projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jonaskuske" el="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/21stCenturyJonas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.'
