Because even though visual aspects of my work can easily be presented on this portfolio site, the development aspects are hard or sometimes impossible to showcase in a graphical way.<br />For example I started developing my own JavaScript library called »miniswipe«, mainly to get accustomed to versioning and publishing with npm and testing my code. »miniswipe« allows users to easily bind functions to swipe gestures. In fact, an early version is used on this very website so you can open and close the menu on mobile devices by swiping left and right.',
