# The Server

A very simple Node server handling the WebSocket connections between the main site and the paired remotes. Note that the server code in this repository only exists so development can happen independently from the production server. The actual server code on the production server looks different.

## Build Instructions

`npm install` – install dependecies
`npm start` – start the development server handling color sync on `localhost:8082`
